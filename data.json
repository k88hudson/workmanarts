One thing always portrayed in all of his artworks, however, is the ocean. Parker uses many different mediums, including drawings, watercolors and prints.  He also did many monotypes, which just so happens to be our current project in class.  This is done by making one unique print by painting on a glass plate and pressing paper onto it.",

Through these films the public can, in most instances, sit back and watch from a safe distance.

This runway-style presentation of wearable couture by Workman artists will challenge norms, shift boundaries and inspire dialogue about mental illness and creativity. Ticket price includes presentation and reception. Participating artists have been selected through a formal adjudication of proposals and will be supported through professional training workshops facilitated by artist/educator Elena Soni, who is working with the artists to best showcase their practice on the garments. The presentation will engage viewers and participants in a dialogue about where art ends and functionality begins. The audience will be treated to an experimental installation/performance in the form of a fashion show. This project will challenge norms, shift boundaries, and engage dialogue about the lives of the creators predicated by mental health and addiction issues and of those who dare don a work of art rather than a garment accepted as normal. Mad Couture Catwalk will include eleven artist \"collections\" in total.",

      "description": "BEING SCENE is an annual juried exhibition produced by Workman Arts for the Center for Addiction and Mental Health. For over a decade, as part of its mandate, BEING SCENE has successfully introduced the general public to the work of thousands of artists who have lived experience with mental illness and addiction, presenting a cross-cultural portrait of the healing power of art in order to build a more respectful and realistic understanding of those recovering from mental illness and addiction. Since its inception in 2000 BEING SCENE has partnered with some of the city’s leading artistic and cultural figures. Among those who have been instrumental in helping BEING SCENE grow into its incredible success are the late artist and educator Lupe Rodriguez, Gillian McIntyre of the AGO, Mary Sue Rankin of the Edward Day Gallery, David Liss of MOCCA and Anna Hudson of Canadian Art. As a result BEING SCENE has evolved to occupy a significant role in Toronto’s cultural landscape, and work originally exhibited primarily on CAMH grounds has gone on to hang at other venues such as the Lieutenant Governor’s Suite at Queen’s Park in Toronto, and the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.",
